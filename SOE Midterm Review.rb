Problem Types 
### Short-response questions on concepts as follows (Not exhaustive)
#	What are the four phases of the SDLC?
	Analysis, Planning, Implementation, Testing.
#	Which phase in the SDLC is the most important? Why?
	Analysis, errors on this step cascade down to the following steps. Therefore it is the most costly.
#	Describe the major elements and issues with waterfall development
	Oldest and most widely used. Requirements solicitation, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, 	Maintenance. 
#	Describe the major elements and issues with parallel development.
#	Describe the major elements and issues with the V-model.
#	Describe the major elements and issues with iterative development.
#	Describe the major elements and issues with prototyping.
#	Describe the major elements and issues with throwaway prototyping
#	Describe the major elements and issues with agile development
#	Compare extreme programming and throwaway prototyping.
#	What are the three ways to deal with complexity?
#	What are model and view?
#	System model = ??

#	What is the difference between generalization and realization?
#	What are the two decomposition methods?
#	What is the difference between upper CASE and lower CASE?
#	What are the trade-offs that project managers must manage?
#	Why is it not a good idea to add more developers to a team to improve productivity?
#	What is scope creep, and how can it be managed?
#	What is a function point and how is it used?
#	Explain what is meant by a functional requirement. 
#	Explain what is meant by a nonfunctional requirement. What are the primary types of nonfunctional requirements?
#	Use two sentences to summarize the difference between functional and nonfunctional requirements.
#	List the major elements in a textual use case
#	What is the purpose of developing use cases during systems analysis?
#	Use cases represent functional requirements or non-functional requirements?
#	What is the purpose of stating the primary actors for the use case?
#	What is the difference between aggregate and composite in UML?
#	What is the difference between extends and includes in use case diagram?
#	What is a scenario? List four types of scenarios.
#	What is the difference between requirements elicitation and analysis?
#	True/False questions

#	Multi-choice questions

#	Analysis questions
#	Given the description of a project, perform project estimation by using FPA and/or industry standards (Formulae will be given) 
#	Given a description of a problem, perform use cases analysis to derive the use case diagrams (UML) and detailed use cases
Sample Question 1:

Multi-choice Questions
1)	Requirements elicitation:
a)	Definition of the system in terms understood by the customer
b)	Definition of the system in terms understood by the developer
c)	Definition of the system in terms understood by the management staff
d)	All of the above
e)	None of the above

2)	A scenario is 
a)	A narrative description of what people do and experience as they try to make use of computer systems and applications
b)	A generic concept that can help us understand the nature of the problem
c)	An abstract concept that can help us make abstractions
d)	All of the above
e)	None of the above


Sample Question 2:

True/False questions
a) Sequence Diagram is the fundamental basis for analysis and design
	True			False
b) Adding more developers to the team always results in better productivity
	True 			False


Sample Question 3:

Campus Housing
The Campus Housing Service helps students find apartments. Owners of apartments fill in information forms about the rental units they have available (e.g., location, number of bedrooms, monthly rent), which are entered into a database. Students can search through this database via the Web to find apartments that meet their needs (e.g., a two-bedroom apartment for $800 or less per month within ½ miles of campus). They then contact the apartment owners directly to see the apartment and possibly rent it. Apartment owners call the service to delete their listing when they have rented their apartment(s).

1)	According to the above description, please draw an UML use case diagram that contains all the major use cases and primary actors of the each use case. Please identify the relationship between use cases if any (in terms of “extend” and “include”)



2)	For each use case obtained above, present the details about the use case as follows.


Use case name

Participating Actors

Flow of events

Entry condition

Exit condition

Quality requirements
